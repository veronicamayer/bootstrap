# Bootstrap

Utilizing the Bootstrap framework I quickly and easily developed a responsive web application. Since the framework provides pre-built CSS and JavaScript components it's a pretty small code base. The goal was to save time and effort in creating a visually appealing and responsive web application, without having to start from scratch.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub pages:
